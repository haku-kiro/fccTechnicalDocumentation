# fccTechnicalDocumentation

A technical documentation page that is one of the projects on [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org).
This website uses content from [elixirSchool](https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/advanced/otp_distribution#distributed-tasks-5), and is used only as content filler. They're a great resource and definitely worth looking at if you want to learn elixir.

You can access the site at, [https://haku-kiro.github.io/fccTechnicalDocumentation/](https://haku-kiro.github.io/fccTechnicalDocumentation/)
